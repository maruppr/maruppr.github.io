Talk at the [Cold Quantum Coffee](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~cqc/) seminar at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, Philosophenweg 16, Heidelberg University. (Online due to Covid-19)

**Abstract:**
*While functional, the classical Feynman diagram approach used to obtain physical observables of scattering processes requires an immense computational effort apart for the simplest of processes. In this talk, I review more modern techniques in the study of scattering amplitudes. Using three ingredients, MHV amplitudes, the so-called BCFW recursion relations and twistor theory, I demonstrate how one can express the full S-matrix of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory at tree-level. This striking result, known as the RSVW formula, is just one of a much broader class of novel formulae for full tree-level S-matrices.*
